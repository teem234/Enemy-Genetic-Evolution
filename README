Player original health, damage, and type are set in player constructor in main. 

Genetic algorithm evolves enemies to defeat a player . This player has predefined starting values that the population will evolve around. 
Some interesting results, occasionally the algorithm may favor high individual crossovers or stat mutations, and other times a strong all around enemy will
be favored.
There is no limit to how strong they can get, although if the mutation function is commented out, they will not be able to gain
random stat boosts that are unrelated to their parents.

The fitness function is a simulated combat experience against the defined player, where health, damage, type, defense, of both
enemy and player are taken into account for a fitness score.

A bug DOES occasionally occur where the enemies will all evolve from parent 0 at times.
